    This function splits the data into 80% used to train models, and 20% for final
    validation.  The learning curves are estimated by then using the training data
    to train a model on just 1 data point, then on 2, etc. up to all of the training
    data.  The performance of the model is then evaluated both on the same data it was
    just trained with, and on the held back 20% of data used for validation. 
    This function collects the RMSE errors on train and validation and returns
    them as the result.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    model - A scikit-learn estimator model to be trained and evaluated.
    X - The input training data
    y - The target labels for training

    Returns
    -------
    train_errors, test_errors - Returns a list of the root mean squared errors
       RMSE of the performance of trained models on the original data trained with,
       and on 20% of the data held back for validation.  The returned arrays are
       the train/test performance on models created with 1 data point, then
       2, etc. up to the 80% of data we use for training models.
